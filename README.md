# OOP school library

> Imagine that you are the librarian of OOP University, and you need a tool to record what books are in the library and who borrows them. The app that I will create will allow you to:

> - Add new students or teachers.
> - Add new books.
> - Save records of who borrowed a given book and when.

## And all of this will be built in a beautiful and well-organized way!
