# OOP-school-library
In this project,Imagine that you are the librarian of OOP University, and you need a tool to record what books are in the library and who borrows them. The app that I will create will allow you to:  Add new students or teachers. Add new books. Save records of who borrowed a given book and when. And all of this will be built in a beautiful and well-organized way! you will start building your school library app. In this initial step, you will implement the classes to represent students and teachers.
